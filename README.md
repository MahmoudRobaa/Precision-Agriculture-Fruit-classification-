# Precision Agriculture Fruit Classification

This project focuses on classifying various types of fruits using deep learning for precision agriculture. Built with **PyTorch** and **MobileNetV3 Large**, it achieves a high accuracy of **99.38%** through transfer learning, supporting better decision-making in crop management.

## Features
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves 99.38% accuracy in classifying fruit types.
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes MobileNetV3 Large for improved performance and efficiency.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Implements feature attribution maps for better interpretability of model predictions.
- **Robust Model:** Adaptable to various agricultural datasets with effective preprocessing and augmentation.
